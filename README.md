# ContactList

A command line application to help users manage their contacts.

If you restart your app, all the contacts will be lost

Task 1: Main menu and user input
When the app starts up it should initially display a menu with options. It then prompts them for input. At this stage, it can just ignore the input and reprint the main menu.

The menu: What would you like do next? new - Create a new contact list - List all contacts quit - Exit Application > _

Task 2: 'quit' command
When the user inputs quit, then the app should terminate. 

Task 3: 'new' command
If the user types in new into the prompt at the main menu, the command line app should further prompt the user for information about the contact they wish to create. Eg: take a full name and email (separately).

Task 4: 'list' command
When on the main menu, the user can type in list to display a list of all contacts within the app, printed one on each line. Each line should be formatted as:

The number (#) should start with 0 and represents an index or unique ID for each contact. Once the contacts are printed out to the screen, the app should go back to the main menu.

It prints code inside your ContactList class.
